# Task 5 â€“ Wireshark Packet Analysis

## Overview

This task was part of the **Cyber Security Internship** program and focused on learning packet analysis using **Wireshark**. The goal was to gain hands-on experience in capturing, filtering, and analyzing network traffic to understand different protocols and their behavior.

## Steps Performed

1. **Installed Wireshark** on the system.
2. **Started a capture** on the active network interface.
3. **Generated network traffic** by browsing websites and pinging a server.
4. **Stopped the capture** after approximately one minute.
5. **Applied filters** to analyze traffic by protocol (e.g., `dns`, `tcp`, `udp`, `http`).
6. **Identified at least three protocols** within the capture (DNS, TCP, UDP).
7. **Saved the capture file** in `.pcap` format for later analysis.
8. **Summarized findings** including protocol details and packet information.

## Findings

* **DNS (Domain Name System):** Translates domain names into IP addresses.
* **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Provides reliable, ordered communication between applications.
* **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Lightweight protocol used for fast communication without guaranteed delivery.

Additional details such as source/destination IPs, timestamps, and payloads were visible in the packet list pane.

## Outcome

Through this task, I developed:

* Practical **packet capturing and filtering skills**.
* Awareness of **protocol structures and behaviors**.
* Ability to **analyze and save traffic** for future reference.
